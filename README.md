This study aims to apply several deep learning techniques to predict monthly crude palm oil prices. First, we compare the deep learning models with the ARIMA forecasting method. The comparison focuses on three DL algorithms: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Classic Algorithm (ARIMA).
